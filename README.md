# 12V---6V-DC-to-DC-Buck-Converter-on-LTspice
Simulation of 12V-6V DC-DC Buck converter, to remove ideality non zero values of inductive and capacitive resistances are taken. 
Values of different parameters have been calculated theoritically to meet the the 12V to 6V requirement the output in simulation is 5.7V with ripple of 900mA 
due to non ideality of the elements taken.
